# replay keys

This software allows you to connect to an Arduino via Bluetooth, type into a GUI, and replay the keys on almost any modern computer.

Possible use cases:

- Controlling servers when there is no network (yay for failures!).
- Setting up new computers/devices that require keyboard input.
- Pair programming/working with others on their computer.
- Screwing with friends/enemies.

The software and hardware is described at a high level [here](TODO).
